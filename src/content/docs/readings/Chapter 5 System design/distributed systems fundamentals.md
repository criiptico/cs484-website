This reading is a TODO right now. My main goals for it are:

* Introduce the two generals problem and why distributed systems are hard
* Introduce the idea of database replication and why it's hard
* Introduce the CAP theorem and why it's important
* Introduce eventual consistency and strong consistency
* Introduce the Raft consensus algorithm
* Provide examples of where Raft is used in practice and why
* Introduce the idea of sharding 


### Additional materials

I haven't watched these all the way through, but they seem like they'd be useful:
